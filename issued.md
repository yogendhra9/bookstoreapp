Create a component for close button
when I press on that button it has to display the current page not the home page
   showing home page coz
   <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
this was the path provided using that link function in close operation
when I am in home page and open login box and press on close button it doesnt close coz it has opened on the "/" and destination is also the same
